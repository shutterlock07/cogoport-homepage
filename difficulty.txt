1. While making the website responsive, I considered width=768px as a breakpoint and it works fine for width < 768px and width > 1100px , I am unaware of how should I make it responsive even for the widths in between.

2. The containers while reducing the width size, at a point the elements inside the container becomes unresponsive (like a photo) and only the container width and height changes, was not able to figure out those. 

3. The color for the navbar is always yellow even after scroll which should not be the case, I think Javascript is used here.
